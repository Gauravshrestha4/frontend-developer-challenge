# Frontend Developer Challenge #

Implement a web page, which contains 3 tabs (Upcoming Campaigns, Live Campaign, Past campaigns) as defined in
the following mockup.

* Each tab should show the relevant data based on the status of campaign (upcoming, live, past).
* The very first column should show the time diff from today to that campaign's date. (You can consider
any date. If the date is in the future, you can show the number of days in the future. For example, "23
days ahead")
* Add a functionality to schedule a campaign again by opening a calendar on clicking schedule
again icon. (Whatever date you select, should be shown in the first column named "Date". The
time diff shown against it should also be updated)
* Clicking on any item in the row should show a modal with relevant information.(This modal
should be just a simple popup containing all the information relevant to that row item. There is
no specific design requirement for this modal . Use your best judgement to output a nice,
responsive UI.)
* Entire UI should be responsive.
* UI should be same regarding color schemes and layout, button states etc. You can use dummy
content, icons etc though.
* Please use dummy json to populate the table.
* You should use a modern front end framework like **ReactJS**, **AngularJS**, **VueJS** etc to
implement this.
* It should support basic localization of strings in 2 languages. There should be a button to select
between different languages. **(Optional bonus point)**
